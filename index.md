# Portfolio by Ryan Riparetti

This portfolio is meant to display two things:
1. The skills I have learned from resources such as Python Crash Course and Jose Portilla's "Python For Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" on Udemy.
2. My innate ability to self-learn, and be engaged within a subject matter unfamiliar to me.

The following notebook pages are of topics that personally interest me. As these topics and datasets genuinely interest me, I am able to ask more effective questions that help me explore the data. 

## Recommender systems of beers 
When I drink beer, I typically play it safe, getting the same beer styles or the same beer over and over without really looking for anything new. 
This notebook from Kaggle compiled reviews from BeerAdvocate.com, in which I was able to build recommendation systems for any beer in that dataset.

## Glass classification


## Steam games reviews
This notebook looks at 40000 games for sale on Steam, which is a popular service to buy games. 

## Path of Exile character information
This notebook pulls information from Path of Exile's API. Path of Exile is an Action-RPG akin to Diablo II. In Path of Exile, there are many ways to customize and build your character. As such, this notebook pulls from the API to give a plethora of information of the top 15,000 characters, including class, level, items equipped, what skills they use, etc.
