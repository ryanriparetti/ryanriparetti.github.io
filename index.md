# Portfolio by Ryan Riparetti

This portfolio is meant to display the proficiencies I have learned, as well as the exploration of topics that genuinely interest me. 

## Projects

### Recommender systems of beers
When I drink beer, I typically play it safe, getting the same beer styles or the same beer over and over without really looking for anything new. This notebook explored more than a million beer reviews found on Kaggle, using data from BeerAdvocate.com. In this dataset, I build a recommendation system and a dashboard to visualize recommendations pulled from the reviews.

### Analysis and Prediction of a Car's Footprint
In a world where cars can reach more than 60 miles per gallon in fuel efficiency, my car is reaching about 24 mpg. This notebook looks at 900 car models, pulling from a dataset from Kaggle, to generate a prediction on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Taking the most important features, I made a dashboard, allowing the user to input certain features to estimate the CO2 emissions.

### Path of Exile inventory and build analysis

Path of Exile, the spiritual successor to the Diablo II, is a loot-driven game. Items picked up in the game can make and break builds, and as such, there is always a need for third party programs. One program, poe.ninja, offers a breakdown of the top characters on the ladder. There is a use to improve this, by looking at items that glue the build together to make it functional. I aim to pull the items that I acquired and pull the items that the leaders on the ladder use, to generate build ideas based on what I have. 

### Indianapolis Potholes

Indianapolis roads were a major adjustment for me to get used to. Almost every winter, I hit a pothole which causes my tire to lose pressure and is a major hassle. There is a public dataset from Socrata that compiled pothole requests over a certain time period. This notebook analyzes the relationship between the contact method (how the pothole was reported) compared to the length of time it'd take to close the pothole report. 


### Path of Exile character information

Path of Exile is an Action-RPG akin to Diablo II. In Path of Exile, there are many ways to build your character. This notebook pulls from the games API to give a plethora of information of the top 15000 characters of the league, including class, level, items equipped, what skills they use, etc.
