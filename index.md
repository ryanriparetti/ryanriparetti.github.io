# Portfolio by Ryan Riparetti

This portfolio is meant to display the proficiencies I have learned, as well as the exploration of topics that genuinely interest me. 

## Projects

### [Recommender Systems of Beers](https://nbviewer.org/github/ryanriparetti/ryanriparetti.github.io/blob/main/Beer_Reviews.ipynb)
When I drink beer, I typically get similarly-styled beers or even the same beer without really looking for anything new. I used this project as a means to help me suggest beers from other beers that others have liked. This notebook explored more than a million beer reviews found on Kaggle, using data from BeerAdvocate.com. In this dataset, I build a recommendation system  and a very simple dashboard to visualize recommendations pulled from the reviews.

### [Analysis and Prediction of a Car's Footprint](https://nbviewer.org/github/ryanriparetti/ryanriparetti.github.io/blob/main/2022%20Fuel%20Consumption%20Rating.ipynb)
In a world where cars can reach more than 60 miles per gallon in fuel efficiency, my car falls short. This notebook looks at 900 car models, pulling from a dataset from Kaggle, to generate a model that can predict CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on a number of obvious and un-obvious features.

### [Path of Exile Ladder Analysis](https://nbviewer.org/github/ryanriparetti/ryanriparetti.github.io/blob/main/Path%20of%20Exile%20API%20Queries.ipynb)

Path of Exile, the spiritual successor to the Diablo II, is a seasonal ARPG. Each season consists of four leages: Softcore Trade, Softcore Solo Self-Found, Hardcore Trade, and Hardcore Solo Self-Found. In this notebook I accessed ladder information of all four leagues approximately 5 weeks into the league, pulling information from 60,000 characters. I extracted the data using SQL and cleaned the data with Pandas to answer questions on the data that I had. 

### [Indianapolis Potholes]()

Indianapolis roads were a major adjustment for me to get used to. Every winter and especially in the early Spring as the weather warms up, Indianapolis roads are littered with potholes. There is a public dataset from Socrata that compiled pothole repair requests over a certain time period. This notebook analyzes the relationship between the contact method (how the pothole was reported) among other features to model how long the pothole report will remain active.
