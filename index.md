# Portfolio by Ryan Riparetti

This portfolio is meant to display two things:
1. The skills I have learned from resources such as Python Crash Course and Jose Portilla's "Python For Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" on Udemy.
2. My innate ability to self-learn, and be engaged within a subject matter unfamiliar to me.

The following notebooks are about topics that personally interest me, and allow me to genuinely try to come up with insights and scripts that I want to use, or can see myself, a friend, or a colleague using. 

## Projects

### Recommender systems of beers
When I drink beer, I typically play it safe, getting the same beer styles or the same beer over and over without really looking for anything new. 
This notebook from Kaggle compiled reviews from BeerAdvocate.com, in which I was able to build recommendation systems for any beer in that dataset. In addition to that, I was able to build a rudimentary search and recommend loop.

Displayed skills: Recommender Systems, Visualization, Data Cleaning

### Analysis and Prediction of a Car's Footprint
Every now and then I think I should get a new car that is far more fuel efficient and likely comes with better features and a higher safety rating than a car made 13 years ago. In a world where cars can get past 60 mpg, mine is less than half of that. In this notebook using data from Kaggle, I evaluate more than 900 car models and try to predict their CO2 and smog rating (from a scale of 1 to 10), while also looking at the relation between a number of features and CO2 emissions.

Displayed skills: Visualization, Multinomial Regression, Logistic Regression



### Glass classification

This notebook looks at the chemical composition of 6 types of glass, of about 200 entries. From this, we can extract binary features (e.g. type 1 or not type 1) as well as numerical features such as refractive index and chemical composition. It would be very interesting to test different models (e.g. KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree vs Random Forest) to see which model can best separate the

### Steam games reviews
This notebook looks at 40000 games for sale on Steam, which is a popular service to buy games. The most interesting part of this database is that it contains tags, e.g. all the classifications of games, as well as the user reviews, including number of reviews and overall rating.

### Path of Exile character information
This notebook pulls information from Path of Exile's API. Path of Exile is an Action-RPG akin to Diablo II. In Path of Exile, there are many ways to customize and build your character. As such, this notebook pulls from the API to give a plethora of information of the top 15,000 characters, including class, level, items equipped, what skills they use, etc.
